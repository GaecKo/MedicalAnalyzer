# NeuroMedFile-Vision
NeuroMedFile-Vision is a small website based on RestAPI that allows you to display DICOM &amp; EEG medical files, with many features. This is espacially useful for neurosciences


# Info about the resource used by the project (temporary):
1. Useless 
2. Trace of EDF (basics)
3. Trace of EDF with epochs
4. Power Spectrum from EEG (using FFT / DFT)
5. Filter with ideal highpass / lowpass
6. DICOM visualizer + basic info
7. Sobel Filter on DICOM 
8. Hounsfield Windowing on DICOM
